# ðŸ‚¡Â ChickenÂ Dinner â€” Blackjack Strategy Trainer

## Overview

**ChickenÂ Dinner** is a minimalist, MonkeyTypeâ€‘inspired web app that teaches players to make perfect, "bookâ€‘correct" decisions at blackjack.  The site deals cards, asks the user to choose an action (Hit, Stand, Double, Split, or Surrender), and immediately shows whether that action matches optimal basic strategy.  Every hand, decision, and result is tracked inâ€‘session to build live statistics and a postâ€‘session review.

### Purpose &Â Goals

- **Skillâ€‘building, not gambling.**  No real or simulated currency is exchanged; the focus is purely on learning.
- **Fast, distractionâ€‘free UX.**  Loads instantly, runs offline as a PWA, and never requires signâ€‘in for core training.
- **Actionable feedback.**  Users see both *right/wrong* feedback **and** the correct move so they can learn per hand.
- **High accessibility standards.**  Keyboard shortcuts, colorâ€‘blindâ€‘safe palette, and `ariaâ€‘live` announcements.


#### Gameplay Loop

- **Multiâ€‘Hand Support**: Players can play up to **8 hands at once** by default, with the number of hands configurable in the Settings menu.
- **Splits**: Each individual hand may be **split up to 4 times**, subject to rule conditions. Split hands remain associated with their parent hand grouping.
- **Dealing Order**: Cards are dealt **right to left**, and played **right to left** as wellâ€”split hands follow the same directional rule.
- **Decision Evaluation**: Every action (Hit, Stand, Double, Split, Surrender) is validated against basic strategy. If a move is incorrect, the system records the correct one.
- **Dealer Behavior**: Dealer reveals the hidden card first, then plays out their hand according to current table rules (default: **hit on soft 17**).
- **Outcome Recording**: Win/loss for each hand vs. dealer is recorded for stats.

### Key Features

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zeroâ€‘Scroll Home**           | Single, viewportâ€‘filling landing screenâ€”no scrolling required.  The blackjack table is preâ€‘dealt and ready to play immediately, with a prominent hotâ€‘keyable **Play** CTA.  Minimal text keeps the user focused on action.                            |
| **Live Game Engine**           | Defaults to a *6â€‘deck shoe* that shuffles only when the shoe is exhausted.  Dealer hits on softÂ 17.  All table rulesâ€”including deck count, hit/standÂ 17, surrender availability, and shuffle pointâ€”are configurable via an inâ€‘app **Settings** modal. |
| **Strategy Checker**           | Every decision is compared against the basicâ€‘strategy lookup; incorrect moves show the *exact* correct action.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Session &Â Extensible Stats** | Tracks accuracyâ€¯%, winâ€¯%, doubles won, splits won, streaks.  Free (nonâ€‘auth) tier stores data in `sessionStorage`; architecture exposes an event bus/API hooks so premium tiers can persist history to a backend.                                     |
| **Review Mode**                | Instant timeline of the current sessionâ€™s hands with replay and filter pills (All / Incorrect / Doubles / Splits).                                                                                                                                    |
| **ResponsiveÂ +Â PWA**           | Tailwind layout scales from mobile to 4K; Vite PWA plugin (future) enables offline training.                                                                                                                                                          |

### Design Inspiration

- **MonkeyType.com** â€” clean typographyâ€‘first layout and focus on a single action loop.

- **Blackjack table palette** â€” charcoalÂ `#1e1e1e` background + feltÂ greenÂ `#00aa66` accent.

- **JetBrainsÂ Mono** font for a codingâ€‘esque, highâ€‘legibility vibe.

- **Chicken Dinner layout** â€” minimalist UI on a light grey or dark background (user configurable). The central blackjack table is pillâ€‘shaped and centered visually, matching the tabletop aesthetic. Core actions (Hit, Stand, Double, Split) are rendered as rounded buttons below. The logo and highlights use the same table green for consistency and visual reinforcement.
